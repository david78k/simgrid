                ************************************************
                ***  This file is a TODO. It is thus kinda   ***
                ***  outdated. You know the story, right?    ***
                ************************************************

### Ongoing stuff
###

Document host module

/* FIXME: better place? */
int vasprintf  (char **ptr, const char *fmt, va_list ap);
char *bprintf(const char*fmt, ...) _XBT_GNUC_PRINTF(1,2);

### Planned
###

*
* XBT
*****

[errors/exception]
  * Better split casual errors from programming errors.
    The first ones should be reported to the user, the second should kill
    the program (or, yet better, only the msg handler)
  * Allows the use of an error handler depending on the current module (ie,
    the same philosophy as log4c using GSL's error functions)

[logs]
  * Hijack message from a given category to another for a while (to mask
    initializations, and more)
  * Allow each actor to have its own setting
  * more logging appenders (take those from Ralf in l2)

[modules]
  * Add configuration and dependencies to our module definition

[other modules]
  * we may need a round-robin database module, and a statistical one
  * Some of the datacontainer modules seem to overlap. Kill some of them?
    - replace fifo with dynars
    - replace set with SWAG
